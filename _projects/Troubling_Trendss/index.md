# Introduction
In early 2025, two foreign-flagged vessels, registered in Tanzania and Togo, damaged major undersea cables linking Taiwan to the global internet just months apart. Despite their different flag registries, both were crewed by Chinese nationals. Cable disruptions are not new for Taiwan; in past years, damage has often been attributed to “accidental anchoring” or “natural degradation”. What distinguishes the 2025 incidents is their growing frequency and the strategic use of flags of convenience, suggesting deliberate intent. These incidents have prompted an unprecedented government and legal response, emphasizing Taiwan’s growing resolve to treat cable disruptions as national security issues. The incidents expose critical vulnerabilities in Taiwan’s digital infrastructure, while highlighting China’s use of ambiguous, deniable tactics that stop just short of open conflict.  

Taiwan’s internet connectivity depends on 15 submarine cables that land at just seven stations across the island. These cables, which form the backbone of the global internet and serve as Taiwan’s lifeline for international communication, lie exposed on the ocean floor, and situated in some of the world’s most congested maritime waters. Unlike many countries that supplement their internet infrastructure with satellite systems, Taiwan is overwhelmingly dependent on these vulnerable cables. Over 95% of global communications are transmitted through undersea cables, making Taiwan’s digital infrastructure a critical security risk.
