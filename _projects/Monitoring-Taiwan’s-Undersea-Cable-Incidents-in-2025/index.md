# Introduction
In early 2025, two foreign-flagged vessels, registered in Tanzania and Togo, damaged major undersea cables linking Taiwan to the global internet just months apart. Despite their different flag registries, both were crewed by Chinese nationals. Cable disruptions are not new for Taiwan; in past years, damage has often been attributed to “accidental anchoring” or “natural degradation”. What distinguishes the 2025 incidents is their growing frequency and the strategic use of flags of convenience, suggesting deliberate intent. These incidents have prompted an unprecedented government and legal response, emphasizing Taiwan’s growing resolve to treat cable disruptions as national security issues. The incidents expose critical vulnerabilities in Taiwan’s digital infrastructure, while highlighting China’s use of ambiguous, deniable tactics that stop just short of open conflict.  

Taiwan’s internet connectivity depends on 15 submarine cables that land at just seven stations across the island. These cables, which form the backbone of the global internet and serve as Taiwan’s lifeline for international communication, lie exposed on the ocean floor, and situated in some of the world’s most congested maritime waters. Unlike many countries that supplement their internet infrastructure with satellite systems, Taiwan is overwhelmingly dependent on these vulnerable cables. Over 95% of global communications are transmitted through undersea cables, making Taiwan’s digital infrastructure a critical security risk.

## Structural Vulnerabilities
Taiwan’s cable weaknesses stem from both its geography and geopolitics. As an island nation, Taiwan lacks the land-based connectivity options available to continental countries. Its reliance on a small number of undersea cables for internet connectivity poses significant geopolitical risks and vulnerabilities. As previously stated, this is compounded by the fact the locations of these cables are publicly available and can be easily found on the ocean floor, raising concerns about potential sabotage or foreign interference.

## Historical Precedent
The Matsu Islands, along with Kinmen, have long held strategic significance in Cross-Strait relations. During both the First and Second Taiwan Strait Crisis, these islands served as key flashpoints. Their proximity to China makes them particularly vulnerable to low-level coercive actions or sabotage. ...

## Escalations in Recent Years
Concerns about deliberate interference intensified in 2023, when two undersea cables were severed just six days apart. The resulting blackout left approximately 12,700 residents without stable internet access for 50 days. ...

## Policy Implications
Taiwan’s heavy reliance on subsea internet cables has raised questions within the government about viable alternatives. One prominent option, Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite network, remains a controversial topic. ...

## Dataset / Methodology
The dataset was constructed using publicly available information from a combination of news reports and official government documents, including those issued by Taiwan’s Ministry of Digital Affairs (MODA) and local fisheries authorities.
