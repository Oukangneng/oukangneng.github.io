# Introduction
*Written by Owen O’Connell*

On March 19th, China’s State Council issued an action plan aimed at promoting high-level opening up to attract and better utilize foreign investment. The plan, titled “Making High-level Solid Progress on Foreign Opening, Attracting and Using Foreign Investment at Greater Intensity Plan”, demonstrates the Chinese government’s commitment to further opening up to the outside world to create a favorable international business environment. China is aware that economic liberalization and leveraging foreign investment are crucial in the pursuit of economic growth and development. Although during the COVID-19 era, China’s protocols and measures negatively affected foreign enterprises, they remain steadfast in opening their doors to attract higher levels of foreign investment. This article will summarize the main sections of the policy and provide further analysis.

3月19日，中國國務院公布了一項計劃，旨在促進高度開放以吸引並更好利用外商投資。該計劃名為「紮實推進高水平對外開放-更大力度吸引和利用外資行動方案」，顯示了中國政府進一步向外界開放，以營造良好國際商業環境的承諾。中國已經意識到，在追求經濟增長和發展的過程中，經濟自由化跟利用外商投資至關重要。儘管在COVID-19時代，中國的協議和措施對外國企業產生了負面的影響，但他們仍堅定地敞開大門，以吸引更高水準的外國投資。這篇文章會概括政策要點跟提供進一步的分析。
